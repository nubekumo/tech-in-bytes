## Project Structure
- The Django project already exists; do not scaffold it again.
- Apps: `apps/blog`, `apps/accounts`, `apps/pages`, `apps/core`.
- Templates live in a top-level `templates/` directory, organized by app (e.g., `templates/blog/`, `templates/accounts/`, `templates/core/`).

## Coding Conventions
- Prefer Django’s class-based views (ListView, DetailView, CreateView, etc.).
- Always extend `apps.blog.models.Post` with slug, image, and status logic in models.
- Use Django’s built-in authentication and forms.
- For list views, always use `select_related` and `prefetch_related` to optimize related queries.
- Consider security and performance in every stage of development.

## Error Handling, Validation & Images
- Use the `validate_image` function for image uploads (file size and format only).
- Ensure media settings: `MEDIA_URL = "/media/"` and `MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / "media"`.
- Customize error pages (e.g., 404, 500) to improve user experience and provide helpful information.

## Static & Template Usage
- In HTML templates, always load static with `{% load static %}` at the top.
- Reference assets with `{% static 'css/yourfile.css' %}` to prevent path errors like `/about/static/...`.

## Feature Implementation
- Incrementally add features: CRUD, comments, tags, likes, email recommendation (log to console), search, SEO-friendly URLs, and sitemap.
- Reuse existing HTML/CSS; only add Django template tags or context as needed.

## Admin Enhancements
- Add filters, search fields, and prepopulated slug fields if not added yet.
